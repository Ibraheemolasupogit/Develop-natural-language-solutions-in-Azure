# 🧠 Natural Language Processing on Azure AI  

> End-to-end applied NLP development and deployment using **Azure AI Language**, **Speech**, and **Translator Services** — integrating traditional NLP pipelines with Generative AI and multimodal capabilities.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

This repository demonstrates how I build and operationalise **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** solutions using **Azure AI**.  
It includes **real-world patterns** that can be extended across **healthcare**, **customer service**, and **intelligent search** applications.

Each notebook or script represents a key NLP capability implemented through Azure services and Python SDKs — from **text analytics and custom model training** to **voice-interactive generative agents**.

| 💬 **Q&A and Conversational AI** | Build knowledge bases and conversational bots that understand user intent | Azure AI Language (QnA + CLU) |
| 🏷️ **Custom Classification & Entity Recognition** | Train domain-specific NLP models for text categorisation and named entity extraction | Custom Language Projects |
| 🌍 **Multilingual Translation Pipelines** | Implement real-time translation workflows for text and audio | Azure AI Translator |
| 🎙️ **Speech Recognition & Synthesis** | Convert speech to text, and generate natural voice responses | Azure AI Speech |
| 🧏‍♂️ **Voice Live Agent** | Develop real-time, voice-interactive AI assistants using Azure Voice Live SDK | Azure AI Foundry |
| 🤖 **Audio-Enabled Generative AI** | Integrate speech and text with multimodal generative models for conversational agents | Azure OpenAI / Foundry |

## 🧠 Example Applications  

### 🩺 1. Healthcare Language Understanding  
- Built a **custom entity recognition** model to extract diagnosis, medication, and symptom data from clinical notes.  
- Combined **Azure AI Language NER** with **Power BI dashboards** for insights into patient pathway documentation quality.

### 💼 2. Intelligent Customer Support  
- Developed a **multi-turn Q&A chatbot** integrated with company FAQs using the **Azure AI Language QnA** API.  
- Deployed via **FastAPI + Azure Web App** for scalable, secure access.

### 🌍 3. Real-Time Voice Translation  
- Built a **speech translation app** that detects and translates spoken input across languages using the **Azure Translator Speech** API.  
- Integrated **speech synthesis (TTS)** for multilingual accessibility.

### 🧏‍♀️ 4. Voice-Interactive Generative Agent  
- Experimented with **Voice Live SDK** to create a **voice-driven conversational assistant** that uses **Azure OpenAI** for response generation.  
- The model detects tone, emotion, and language context before producing a response.
